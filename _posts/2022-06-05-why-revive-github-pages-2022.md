So many ideas, so many no-code tools to create a blog, but I'm falling back to my old stomping grounds.

Github Pages offers me the most 'comfortable' place to track my work and since I've been applying to more roles lately, they all seem to ask for a Github link, and hey I get the green little dots on my commits chart.

If you are reading this, I am re-building and starting over. I've talked about a long career in software development, and the PTSD that comes with it. Now I'm entering a new phase in my professional life, and Github seems to feel like home to me.

Here I would like to track my musings and all my ideas.

Thanks for reading.
